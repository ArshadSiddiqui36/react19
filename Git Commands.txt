====================| Git Branch Command |====================
=>List all branches:
1.To see a list of all branches (both local and remote), use:
> git branch
* This will show you all the local branches in your repository,
  with the current branch highlighted in green (or with an asterisk * next to it).

====================| List remote branches |====================
1.To see branches on the remote repository, use:
> git branch -r

====================| List both local and remote branches |====================
1.To list both local and remote branches, use:
> git branch -a

====================| Create a new branch |====================
1.To create a new branch (but not switch to it), use:
> git branch new-branch-name

====================| Delete a branch |====================
1.To delete a branch that you no longer need (make sure you’re not on the branch you want to delete), use:
> git branch -d branch-name

2.If the branch has unmerged changes and you still want to delete it, use:
> git branch -D branch-name

====================| Renaming the Current Branch |====================
1.If you're on the branch you want to rename, run the following command:
> git branch -m new-branch-name

2. Renaming a Branch that You’re Not Currently On:
> git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name

====================| Push the Renamed Branch (If Already Pushed to Remote) |====================
1.Push the renamed branch to the remote repository:
> git push origin new-branch-name

2.If the old branch was already pushed to the remote, you’ll need to delete it from the remote:
> git push origin --delete old-branch-name

3.To set the upstream for your new branch (so that git push works without specifying the branch name), run:
> git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
